    </h3>
    <p class="description">
        An artificial companion who is another you. ‘It’ is the negative side of you, another version of you. It is
        depressed, sad, and passive.
        According to your face, it will automatically generate an avatar looks like yourself and have conversations with
        you.
        <br>
        It can generate an avatar figure like you, chat(in text & sound) with you and provide negative thoughts to you.
        It have the power of decide when to end the conversation and when to start. It can recognize some of your facial
        expressions or gestures and give some suggestions.
        <br>
        It is not a controllable ‘pet’ that you can in charge of. And it is not a happy companion.
