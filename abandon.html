        Designing an interactive website that will let users experience and interact with.
        This project started with the feelings of abandonment.
        The purpose of this project is for users to think about how they feel abandon and envision what will happen
        after a digital or physical space is abandoned.
        This project started with an abandoned city Yumen, China, and shifted to the senses of abandonment in a digital
        space.
        The website combines multiple pages that each page has a topic that represents a feature of abandonment.
        Those topics related to abandonment are adapted from the interview I did asking people how they feel about
        abandonment, especially in digital space.

    <h3>
        About
    </h3>
    <p class="description">
        Users will explore the website while browsing. The website lacks of navigation (it represent a feeling of
        abandonment), therefore, users will explore and try some of the features by themselves. After entering the index
        page, users will be lead to a "navigation page".
        In the "navigation page", the users could chat and when a user moves the mouse over a red block, the sentence
        will appear in both the user's window and all other users' pages. Those red blocks are linked to different pages
        and each page represents a feeling of abandonment from the interview I did.
        On this page, users could also upload their own sketches of a webpage with a name and a URL. The uploaded pages
        will appear in all other users' screens and create a linked section that all users will have access.
        In those separate pages, each page will have different features that either interacts with single users or
        interacts with multiple users.
        This website is aimed at people who are interested in the topic of "abandon" or people who are interested in
        interesting code sketches.
        In the future, the website could be developed as a small community for designers or artists who are willing to
        share creative works related to webpages.
        There is also a 404 page (sense of lost in the digital world) that users need to refresh twice to return to the
        index page.
