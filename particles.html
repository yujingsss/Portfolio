        About
    </h3>
    <p class="description">
        A modular animation depicting the movement of a particle. Consist only three colors, the particle starts with
        red color and bounces back to the middle as a white particle. This particle then spreds out to multiple
        particles bouncing around. When these white particles return to the middle again they will later align into tidy
        lines. The animation ends with all those particles return to their initial red particle state and dropping out
        of the sight.
