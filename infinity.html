        Discovering the journey of identity seeking and the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.
        The major signifiers are mirrors, shadows and the reflection created by lights.
        Communicate between Processing and Arduino. Utilize image processing in Processing and Open CV library as a distance 
        sensor to trigger the lights.
        <br>
        In a distance, the installation seems like a normal mirror.
        When user get closer, the camera attached on the mirror will detect the distance between people and the installation, therefore 
        light up the LED strip and open the Processing sketch. After the LEDs are lighted up, it becomes an infinity mirror reflecting 
        reflecting the user's face which indicates the journey of identity seeking. The Processing sketch is projected on the wall and the human figure captureed by the camera 
        will be separated like a shadow.
        <br>
        The mirrors are laser cut and attached together with six 3d printed stands.
