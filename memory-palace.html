    </h3>
    <p class="description">
        The purpose of this project is to convey the ideas related to consciousness and memories 
        through a cinematic narrative. Viewers within the virtual space 
        granted the ability to walking around, exploring, 
        and find those objects attached with memories in a visible way that would 
        otherwise be unavailable in reality when just recalling traces of unclear memories. 
        Additionally, the spatial aspects and the interactions contribute to the narrative 
        in a more influential way to trigger the emotional impact on the participants.
